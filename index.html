									<h2>Investigate the Link Between the hMLH1 Gene and Microsatellite Instability in Colorectal Carcinoma</h2>
									<p>Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in the world, with the primary causal factor being genomic
									instability. Microsatellite Instability is an indicator of an increased tendency of genome alterations which may be
									caused by defective mismatch repair pathway. hMLH1, is a critical mismatch repair pathways gene known to be
									mutated in Colorectal Carcinoma. Aim of the study was to better understand the relationship between hMLH1 and
									Microsatellite Instability in Colorectal Carcinoma using publicly available datasets. An in silco study was performed
									using a dataset retrieved from cBioportal and the Cancer genome atlas. The results demonstrated that low hMLH1
									expression had significantly higher MSI as expected. However, it interestingly showed an inverse association between
									hMLH1 and fraction of genome alterations. This possibly highlights the complexity of the link between hMLH1 and
									Microsatellite Instability.</p>

									<h2>Age-Dependent Effects of Binge Drinking on Anxiety and Expression of mGlu1</h2>
									<p>Previous studies have established the negative long term effects of binge-drinking during adolescence on proper brain development and anxiety, including reductions in the size of the prefrontal cortex and behavioral delays. However, little work has been done to investigate the effects of binge-drinking at maturity  or in old age.  Using  a Drinking in the Dark (DID) model of binge drinking, , we investigated the potential age-dependent differences in anxiety-like behaviors following binge-drinking in 6 (mature) and 18 (old-age) month old mice Following drinking, mice were tested with common anxiety-inducing behavioral assays including the Forced Swim Test (FST), Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and Novel Object Encounter (NOE). Alongside this, the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor ,mGlu1, within the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) and Hippocampus was quantified using immunohistology. The study found significant differences between binge-drinking and non-drinking mice in every assay, and it was determined  that mGlu1 expression was significantly higher in the mature drinkers than in the old drinkers. Despite this, no significant behavioral differences existed between the mature and old age binge-drinkers, suggesting that levels of anxiety following binge-drinking are not age-dependent.
